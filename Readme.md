This software is meant to investigate performance and image quality of HW encoder (VCE) of AMD.
There are 2 types of software developed, one is command line version that runs independently, and the nother is a output plug-in of [Aviutl](http://spring-fragrance.mints.ne.jp/aviutl/).

VCEEncC.exe … Command line version supporting transcoding.  
VCEEnc.auo … Output plugin for [Aviutl](http://spring-fragrance.mints.ne.jp/aviutl/).
